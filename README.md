# HillsOfKYDancers
Working files for Dancers' webpages.
Project created to give new and current members of the Hills of KY casual dancing students, and the Demo dance team a place to find instructional sheets, videos of dance steps, and a calendar of events that would be of interest to the dancers. (performances, dancer birthdays, etc)
